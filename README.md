# Stokvel-Manager
A Stokvel Manager application that manages payments and allows user interactions in a stokvel.
The data is stored in an access database and uses a jdbc driver to connect the java application to the database.
This application was completed as part of my matric Practical Assessment Task, hence there's some documentation attached that further explains the application and its uses.
I would reccomend running the project file "IT PAT 2021" on Netbeans, as this is where I made the application.
